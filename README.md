# Web Scraping and Code Generation

This project combines web scraping and code generation using NLP techniques to extract content from web pages and generate code based on the extracted information.

## Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. Web Scraping: The web scraping script uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract relevant content from web pages. It recursively follows links within the page up to a specified depth, avoiding duplicate scraping.

2. Text Summarization: After scraping the web pages, the extracted content is summarized using a pre-trained model from the transformers library. The text summarization model condenses the extracted information into a concise summary.

3. Code Generation: The summarized text is then used as a prompt for a code generation model. The code generation model, also using transformers, generates code based on the provided prompt. This allows the project to automatically generate code snippets or examples based on the scraped content.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

2. Run the `scrape_page` function to perform web scraping. Specify the initial URL and the maximum depth for recursive scraping. The scraped content will be saved to a text file named `output.txt`.

3. Run the `text_summarization` script to generate a summary of the scraped content. The summary will be saved to a text file named `summ.txt`.

4. Run the `code_generation` script to generate code based on the summary. The generated code will be printed to the console.

## Customization

- Adjust the HTML parsing logic in the web scraping script to extract specific elements or sections of interest from web pages.
- Experiment with different pre-trained models available in the transformers library for text summarization and code generation.
- Fine-tune the pre-trained models on specific datasets or tasks for better performance.
- Customize parameters such as maximum depth, summary length, beam search size, etc., based on your requirements.
- Explore other NLP techniques or integrate additional functionalities, such as translation, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis.
